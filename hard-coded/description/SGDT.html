<p>Stores the content of the global descriptor table register (GDTR) in the destination operand. The destination operand specifies a memory location.</p>
<p>In legacy or compatibility mode, the destination operand is a 6-byte memory location. If the operand-size attribute is 16 bits, the limit is stored in the low 2 bytes and the 24-bit base address is stored in bytes 3-5, and byte 6 is zero-filled. If the operand-size attribute is 32 bits, the 16-bit limit field of the register is stored in the low 2 bytes of the memory location and the 32-bit base address is stored in the high 4 bytes.</p>
<p>In IA-32e mode, the operand size is fixed at 8+2 bytes. The instruction stores an 8byte base and a 2-byte limit.</p>
<p>SGDT is useful only by operating-system software. However, it can be used in application programs without causing an exception to be generated. See "LGDT/LIDT—Load Global/Interrupt Descriptor Table Register" in Chapter 3, Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual, Volume 2A, for information on loading the GDTR and IDTR.</p>
