<p>Copies doublewords from source operand (second operand) and inserts them in the destination operand (first operand) at the locations selected with the order operand (third operand). Each 2-bit field in the order operand selects the contents of one doubleword location in the destination operand. For example, bits 0 and 1 of the order operand select the contents of doubleword 0 of the destination operand. The encoding of bits 0 and 1 of the order operand determines which doubleword from the source operand will be copied todoubleword 0 of the destination operand.</p>
<p>The source operand can be an XMM register or a 128-bit memory location. The destination operand is an XMM register. The order operand is an 8-bit immediate. Note that this instruction permits a doubleword in the source operand to be copied to more than one doubleword location in the destination operand.</p>
<p>In 64-bit mode, using a REX prefix in the form of REX.R permits this instruction to access additional registers (XMM8-XMM15).</p>
