<p>Performs an interleaved unpack of the low-order single-precision floating-point values from the source operand (second operand) and the destination operand (first operand). The source operand can be an XMM register or a 128-bit memory location; the destination operand is an XMM register.</p>
<p>When unpacking from a memory operand, an implementation may fetch only the appropriate 64 bits; however, alignment to 16-byte boundary and normal segment checking will still be enforced.</p>
<p>In 64-bit mode, using a REX prefix in the form of REX.R permits this instruction to access additional registers (XMM8-XMM15).</p>
