<p>The linear address corresponds to the address of the least-significant byte of the referenced memory data. When a memory address is indicated, the 16 bytes of data at memory location m128 are loaded and the single-precision elements in positions 0 and 2 are duplicated. When the register-register form of this operation is used, the same operation is performed but with data coming from the 128-bit source register.</p>
<p>In 64-bit mode, use of the REX.R prefix permits this instruction to access additional registers (XMM8-XMM15).</p>
