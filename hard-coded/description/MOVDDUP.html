<p>The linear address corresponds to the address of the least-significant byte of the referenced memory data. When a memory address is indicated, the 8 bytes of data at memory location m64 are loaded. When the register-register form of this operation is used, the lower half of the 128-bit source register is duplicated and copied into the 128-bit destination register.</p>
<p>In 64-bit mode, use of the REX.R prefix permits this instruction to access additional registers (XMM8-XMM15).</p>
