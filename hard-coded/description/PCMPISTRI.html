<p>The instruction compares data from two strings based on the encoded value in the Imm8 Control Byte (see Section 4.1, "Imm8 Control Byte Operation for PCMPESTRI /PCMPESTRM / PCMPISTRI / PCMPISTRM"), and generates an index stored to ECX.</p>
<p>Each string is represented by a single value. The value is an xmm (or possibly m128 for the second operand) which contains the data elements of the string (byte or word data). Each input byte/word is augmented with a valid/invalid tag. A byte/word is considered valid only if it has a lower index than the least significant null byte/word. (The least significant null byte/word is also considered invalid.)</p>
<p>The comparison and aggregation operations are performed according to the encoded value of Imm8 bit fields (see Section 4.1). The index of the first (or last, according toimm8[6] ) set bit of IntRes2 is returned in ECX. If no bits are set in IntRes2, ECX is set to 16 (8).</p>
<p>Note that the Arithmetic Flags are written in a non-standard manner in order to supply the most relevant information:</p>
<ul>
<li>CFlag - Reset if IntRes2 is equal to zero, set otherwise</li>
<li>ZFlag - Set if any byte/word of xmm2/mem128 is null, reset otherwise</li>
<li>SFlag - Set if any byte/word of xmm1 is null, reset otherwise</li>
<li>OFlag -IntRes2[0]</li>
<li>AFlag - Reset</li>
<li>PFlag - Reset</li>
<li>Effective Operand Size</li>
</ul>
