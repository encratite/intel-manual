<p>The HSUBPD instruction subtracts horizontally the packed DP FP numbers of both operands.</p>
<p>Subtracts the double-precision floating-point value in the high quadword of the destination operand from the low quadword of the destination operand and stores the result in the low quadword of the destination operand.</p>
<p>Subtracts the double-precision floating-point value in the high quadword of the source operand from the low quadword of the source operand and stores the result in the high quadword of the destination operand.</p>
<p>In 64-bit mode, use of the REX.R prefix permits this instruction to access additional registers (XMM8-XMM15).</p>
