<p>Stores the content the interrupt descriptor table register (IDTR) in the destination operand. The destination operand specifies a 6-byte memory location.</p>
<p>In non-64-bit modes, if the operand-size attribute is 32 bits, the 16-bit limit field of the register is stored in the low 2 bytes of the memory location and the 32-bit base address is stored in the high 4 bytes. If the operand-size attribute is 16 bits, the limit is stored in the low 2 bytes and the 24-bit base address is stored in the third, fourth, and fifth byte, with the sixth byte filled with 0s.</p>
<p>In 64-bit mode, the operand size fixed at 8+2 bytes. The instruction stores 8-byte base and 2-byte limit values.</p>
<p>SIDT is only useful in operating-system software; however, it can be used in application programs without causing an exception to be generated. See "LGDT/LIDT—LoadGlobal/Interrupt Descriptor Table Register" in Chapter 3,Intel®64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual, Volume 2A, for information on loading the GDTR and IDTR.</p>
