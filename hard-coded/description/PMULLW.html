<p>Performs a SIMD signed multiply of the packed signed word integers in the destination operand (first operand) and the source operand (second operand), and stores the low 16 bits of each intermediate 32-bit result in the destination operand. The source operandcan be an MMX technology register or a 64-bit memory location, or it can be an XMM register or a 128-bit memory location. The destination operand can be an MMX technology register or an XMM register.</p>
<p>In 64-bit mode, using a REX prefix in the form of REX.R permits this instruction to access additional registers (XMM8-XMM15).</p>
