<p>Computes the absolute value of the difference of 8 unsigned byte integers from the source operand (second operand) and from the destination operand (first operand). These 8 differences are then summed to produce an unsigned word integer result that is stored in the destination operand. The source operand can be an MMX technology register or a 64-bit memory location or it can be an XMM register or a 128-bit memory location. The destination operand can be an MMX technology register or an XMM register.</p>
<p>When operating on 64-bit operands, the word integer result is stored in the low word of the destination operand, and the remaining bytes in the destination operand are cleared to all 0s.</p>
<p>When operating on 128-bit operands, two packed results are computed. Here, the 8 low-order bytes of the source and destination operands are operated on to produce a word result that is stored in the low word of the destination operand, and the 8 high-order bytes are operated on to produce a word result that is stored in bits 64 through</p>
