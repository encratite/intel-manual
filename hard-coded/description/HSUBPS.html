<p>Subtracts the single-precision floating-point value in the second dword of the destination operand from the first dword of the destination operand and stores the result in the first dword of the destination operand.</p>
<p>Subtracts the single-precision floating-point value in the fourth dword of the destination operand from the third dword of the destination operand and stores the result in the second dword of the destination operand.</p>
<p>Subtracts the single-precision floating-point value in the second dword of the source operand from the first dword of the source operand and stores the result in the third dword of the destination operand.</p>
<p>Subtracts the single-precision floating-point value in the fourth dword of the source operand from the third dword of the source operand and stores the result in the fourth dword of the destination operand.</p>
<p>In 64-bit mode, use of the REX.R prefix permits this instruction to access additional registers (XMM8-XMM15).</p>
