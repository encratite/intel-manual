<p>Shifts the bits in the individual data elements (words or doublewords) in the destination operand (first operand) to the right by the number of bits specified in the count operand (second operand). As the bits in the data elements are shifted right, the empty high-order bits are filled with the initial value of the sign bit of the data element. If the value specified by the count operand is greater than 15 (for words) or 31 (for doublewords), each destination data element is filled with the initial value of the sign bit of the element.</p>
<p>The destination operand may be an MMX technology register or an XMM register; the count operand can be either an MMX technology register or an 64-bit memory location, an XMM register or a 128-bit memory location, or an 8-bit immediate. Note that only the first 64-bits of a 128-bit count operand are checked to compute the count.</p>
<p>The PSRAW instruction shifts each of the words in the destination operand to the right by the number of bits specified in the count operand, and the PSRAD instruction shifts each of the doublewords in the destination operand.</p>
<p>In 64-bit mode, using a REX prefix in the form of REX.R permits this instruction to access additional registers (XMM8-XMM15).</p>
