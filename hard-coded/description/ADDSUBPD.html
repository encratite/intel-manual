<p>Adds the double-precision floating-point values in the high quadword of the source and destination operands and stores the result in the high quadword of the destination operand.</p>
<p>Subtracts the double-precision floating-point value in the low quadword of the source operand from the low quadword of the destination operand and stores the result in the low quadword of the destination operand.</p>
<p>The source operand can be a 128-bit memory location or an XMM register. The destination operand is an XMM register.</p>
<p>In 64-bit mode, using a REX prefix in the form of REX.R permits this instruction to access additional registers (XMM8-XMM15).</p>
