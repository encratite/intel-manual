<p>Multiplies the individual signed words of the destination operand (first operand) by the corresponding signed words of the source operand (second operand), producing temporary signed, doubleword results. The adjacent doubleword results are then summed and stored in the destination operand. For example, the corresponding low-order words (15-0) and (31-16) in the source and destination operands are multiplied by one another and the doubleword results are added together and stored in the low doubleword of the destination register (31-0). The same operation is performed on the other pairs of adjacent words. The source operand can be an MMX technology register or a 64-bit memory location, or it can be an XMM register or a 128-bit memory location. The destination operand can be an MMX technology register or an XMM register.</p>
<p>The PMADDWD instruction wraps around only in one situation: when the 2 pairs of words being operated on in a group are all 8000H. In this case, the result wraps around to 80000000H.</p>
<p>In 64-bit mode, using a REX prefix in the form of REX.R permits this instruction to access additional registers (XMM8-XMM15).</p>
