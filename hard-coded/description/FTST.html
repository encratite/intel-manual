<p>This instruction performs an "unordered comparison." An unordered comparison also checks the class of the numbers being compared (see "FXAMâ€”Examine ModR/M" inthis chapter). If the value in register ST(0) is a NaN or is in an undefined format, the condition flags are set to "unordered" and the invalid operation exception is generated.</p>
<p>The sign of zero is ignored, so that (-0.0 = +0.0).</p>
<p>This instruction's operation is the same in non-64-bit modes and 64-bit mode.</p>
